# NN Regression Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Neural Network-based Regression model using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features
- Implements a deep learning regression model.
- Uses a dataset for training (mention dataset if applicable).
- Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) & Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Supports real-time predictions based on trained models.
