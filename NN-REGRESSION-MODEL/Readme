NN Regression Model

Overview

This project demonstrates a Neural Network-based Regression model using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is designed to predict continuous values based on input features, making it suitable for applications like stock price prediction, real estate valuation, and energy consumption forecasting.

Features

Implements a deep learning regression model.

Uses a dataset for training (mention dataset if applicable).

Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) & Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Supports real-time predictions based on trained models.
